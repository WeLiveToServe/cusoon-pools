## Why This Design
1. It targets your exact audience: homeowners already paying someone else.
2. It leads with a contrast hook (attention/excuses) instead of generic "we clean pools" copy.
3. It combines outcome language (clear water, less stress) with trust signals (testimonial + transparent pricing).
4. It uses one strong offer to reduce friction without discounting your core weekly service value.
5. It keeps response options simple: phone/text first, QR/URL second.

## Print/Compliance Notes
- Keep permit/address region clear on the back right half.
- Use high-contrast text only; avoid thin fonts over water imagery.
- Add a QR code to: `https://cusoon-pools.com/contact?src=dm-postcard-1`
- Export print PDF as CMYK at 300 DPI with bleed marks.
